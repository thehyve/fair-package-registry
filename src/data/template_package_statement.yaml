# Notes on usage:
# If a field value is not present, leave that line out. If a list is empty, use an empty list: []
# Taxonomy terms are those coming from the Cochrane Core Ontology where possible, otherwise use custom terms. If using custom terms, add them to the taxonomy tab in the fair-package-registry Excel sheet.
# If using new terms from one of the ontologies, like OBI or STATO, add them to the corresponding ontology class in the package_statements.py script.

  - description: Uitgebreide patiëntinformatie en richtlijnen voor professionals over bij welke subgroep van vrouwen deze genexpressietesten van toegevoegde waarde zou kunnen zijn en wat de implicaties zijn, zodat de vrouw in overleg met haar arts een weloverwogen besluit kan nemen of inzet van een genexpressietest in het individuele geval van toegevoegde waarde is (samen beslissen). De BVN heeft toegezegd in afstemming met Patiëntfederatie Nederland de bestaande patiënteninformatie te updaten vóór maart 2024. 
  - description: Revisie van de huidige richtlijn waarin de resultaten van de RxPonder-studie, TailorX-studie (Oncotype DX®) en 8-jaars resultaten van de MINDACT-studie (MammaPrint®) zijn opgenomen. De NABON heeft toegezegd dat de module wordt geprioriteerd voor de volgende jaarlijkse cyclus. Omdat het updaten van richtlijnen niet op korte termijn gerealiseerd is, zal de beroepsgroep een standpunt publiceren over MammaPrint en Oncotype DX op haar website.
  - description: Inzet van genexpressietesten alleen als add-on-test aan de standaard risicoschatting, indien op basis van de standaard risicoschatting twijfel bestaat over de meerwaarde van adjuvante chemotherapie. Het is niet de bedoeling om de genexpressietest in plaats van de standaard risicoschatting in te zetten. 
  - description: Vanwege het ontbreken van de directe vergelijking weten we nu niet welke test de meeste gezondheidswinst voor de patiënt oplevert. De beroepsgroep spant zich in om hier inzicht in te krijgen door het bijhouden van de internationale literatuur en/of uitkomsten uit registraties. Het Zorginstituut zal jaarlijks navraag doen bij de beroepsgroep of er nieuwe publicaties verschenen zijn. 
  - description: Inzet van één van de testen per tumor (en niet beide testen). Dat de twee testen niet uitwisselbaar zijn zou er mogelijk toe kunnen leiden dat zorgprofessionals en patiënten geneigd zijn om beide testen bij één patiënt af te nemen, om alleen bij concordante uitslagen (dezelfde uitslagen) een patiënt te informeren over het advies over wel of geen adjuvante chemotherapie. Het is echter niet onderzocht of het klinisch nuttig en doelmatig is om beide testen bij één patiënt af te nemen. Het Zorginstituut is daarom van mening dat de inzet van genexpressie testen beperkt moet blijven tot één van de testen per tumor.  
  - description: Het Zorginstituut zal monitoren en evalueren of er sprake is van gepast gebruik van de testen. In nauwe afstemming met de beroepsgroep worden hiervoor eindpunten gedefinieerd.
